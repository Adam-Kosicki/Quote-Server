# Quote-Sharing-between-Client-and-Server
The C project consists of two programs, "quoteclient.c" and "quoteserver.c", along with a text file "quotes.txt". The "quoteclient.c" program facilitates communication with the server by creating a client FIFO (named pipe), sending its name to the server, and then receiving a random quote from the server via the named pipe. The "quoteserver.c" program reads quotes from the "quotes.txt" file and waits for client requests. It listens for client FIFOs, randomly selects a quote, sends it to the client, and repeats the process indefinitely. The project enables users to request and receive inspirational quotes from the server. Note that the project assumes that the client and server programs are executed in a compatible environment.
